# 3D-Game-Tutorial-001

This is the first tutorial of a series of tutorials about creating an OpenGL 3D Game from scratch using PureBasic as programming language. I have chosen to go with GLFW for Window and Inputs management. Also to have OpenGL functionalty I have chosen GLEW. 

The choice of GLFW and GLEW was made to have a Cross-platform solution. 

# About this tutorial

If everything goes as planned you should end up with a window with a RED screen. You can Toggle between WindowedScreen mode and FullScreen mode by pressing "F1" key, Press "Esc" key to close the program.

It's just to make sure you have everything setted up and ready to go.
